This is a demo app for [remoteStorage.js](http://remotestorage.io/integrate/).

# Quick Start

[1] Visit this app with your browser
* At https://myfavoritedrinks.remotestorage.io/ where it's hosted
* Or clone this repo and run `npx serve` in the repo root
* the app needs to be hosted using a Web server--don't just open [index.html](index.html) from your file system

[2] Get a storage account.
* See the [remoteStorage documentation](https://remotestorage.io/get.html)
* There are [many options](https://remotestorage.io/servers.html), including self-hosting or running a remoteStorage server on localhost.

[3] Click on the *remotestorage* widget (logo)

[4] type in `user@provider.com` in the input field of the widget, click through

[5] what happens at this point is server specific, OAuth flow should redirect you to onboarding and/or login
